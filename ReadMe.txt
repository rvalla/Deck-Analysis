Deck-Analysis Version Readme

Deck-Analysis is a very little piece of software to evaluate possible orders for the cards
at the deck and its behavior with the "Faro shuffle".
While 'deckconsole' allows you to test some situations on a terminal window you may want to
code and use the methods provided in 'faroshuffle' and 'deckmethods' in your own way.
More details in the code comments.
